I. What It's All About </h2>

<p>
Whence come the thousands of photographs used every month by newspapers and magazines? </p>

<p4>
 More than that, whence do the photographs come which are used by makers of calendars, postcards, for advertisements, and for illustrating books, stories and articles? </p4>

<p4>
This little book is a practical, up-to-the-minute answer to the question: "How can I make my camera-work profitable?" </p4>

<h6>A. H. Beardsley,
Publisher, Photo-Era Magazine.</h6>

<p4> <p>At first thought, the answer is,<em> "From professional photographers and publisher-photo-services."</em> But professional photographers do not produce one-third of the photographs used, and publisher-photo-services are supplied by that same large number of camerists that supply publications with most of their prints.</p>

  No one can deny that the greatest number of prints published are bought from amateur photographers in towns no larger than the average, and sometimes smaller.</p>

  <p5>The camerist does not have to get in an air-ship and fly to Africa in order to produce photographs that will sell. Read what Waldon Fawcett says, himself a success at selling his photographs:

<blockquote>"The photographer is apt to think that all his ambitions would be realised if only he could journey to foreign shores or to distant corners of our country; or if he could attend the spectacular events that focus the attention of the world now and then. <em>This is a delusion. The real triumph is that of the photographer who utilises the material ready at hand in his own district, be it large or small."</em>

  In short, ability to make metaphors, create lovely heroines or such is not at all necessary to the successful selling of photographs to publications.
